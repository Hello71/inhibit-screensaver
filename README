This is an implementation of a standalone pipe-based command-line inhibitor
based on the VLC D-Bus inhibitor.

Instead of using the D-Bus unregistration to guarantee uninhibition, this uses
a pipe which is automatically closed when the holder exits. Thus, the caller
application can be written without using D-Bus support (preferable in certain
cases).

Examples in bash, POSIX sh, and C are provided.
